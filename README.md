# Analysis-of-voting-patterns-in-the-Irish-Parliament.

Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The National Parliament (the Oireachtas) consists of the President
and two Houses: Dáil Éireann (House of Representatives) and Seanad Éireann (the Senate). The members of
Dail Éireann, called Teachtaí Dála (TDs), are directly elected by the people. More information may be found
at www.oireachtas.ie.

The votes of TDs are recorded and posted on www.oireachtas.ie. During the 5th session of the 32nd Dáil
Éireann (7 September 2019 - 14 January 2020 inclusive) there were a number of votes in Dáil Éireann by the set
of elected TDs. Data on whether each TD voted yes or not for six of these votes have been downloaded from the
Oireachtas website and are posted on Brightspace in the file 32ndDail_FifthSession_BinaryVotes.Rdata.
The data record if a TD was voted yes (coded 2) or not (coded 1). The main topic of each vote is summarised
in the column headings; for example, ‘HousingMinister’ relates to a vote on a motion of no confidence in the
current Minister for Housing. (See the linked websites above for further details on the 6 votes which took
place on November 28th and December 3rd, 4th, 5th, 12th and 18th 2019 respectively).


Interest lies in clustering the TDs to uncover groups with similar attendance and/or voting patterns.
